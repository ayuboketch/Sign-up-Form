This is one of Odins Challenges. It is perhaps one of the most important elements on a website. 
The <form> elements is important because it is how the website takes information and interacts with the end user. 
It is very important to let the user understand what is required of them without minimising their experince.
This project amplifies the design and experince of the user with a clean natural flowing asthetic which colorful input boxes showing the user what is required to get your services.
Ofcourse there is alot of modifications needed to make this page work for you but it helps the end user enjoy their experience when visitng your website.
